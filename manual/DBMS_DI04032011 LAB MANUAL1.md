## Preface

The primary aim of any laboratory/Practical/field work is enhancement of required skills as well as creative ability amongst students to solve real time problems by developing relevant competencies in psychomotor  domain.  Keeping  in  view,  GTU  has  designed  competency  focused  outcome-based curriculum -2021 (COGC-2021) for Diploma engineering programmes. In this more time is allotted to practical work than theory. It shows importance of enhancement of skills amongst students and it pays attention to utilize every second of time allotted for practical amongst Students, Instructors and Lecturers to achieve relevant outcomes by performing rather than writing practice in study type. It is essential for effective  implementation  of  competency  focused  outcome-  based  Green  curriculum-2021.  Every practical has been keenly designed to serve as a tool to develop &amp; enhance relevant industry needed competency in each and every student. These psychomotor skills are very difficult to develop through traditional chalk and board content delivery method in the classroom. Accordingly, this lab manual has been designed to focus on the industry defined relevant outcomes, rather than old practice of conducting practical to prove concept and theory.

By using this lab manual, students can read procedure one day in advance to actual performance day  of  practical  experiment  which  generates  interest  and  also,  they  can  have  idea  of  judgement  of magnitude prior to performance. This in turn enhances predetermined outcomes amongst students. Each and every Experiment /Practical in this manual begins by competency, industry relevant skills, course outcomes as well as practical outcomes which serve as a key role for doing the practical. The students will also have a clear idea of  safety and necessary precautions to be taken while performing experiment.

This manual also provides guidelines to lecturers to facilitate student-centered lab activities for each practical/experiment by arranging and managing necessary resources in order that the students follow the procedures with required safety and necessary precautions to achieve outcomes. It also gives an idea that how students will be assessed by providing Rubrics.

Internet is widely used in different areas such as banking, e-commerce, education and many others. Different technologies are used to develop web applications but HTML is the core component in all types of applications for formatting and presenting the web content. This course will impart skill sets related to designing HTML web pages, using cascading style sheets and embedding Java script using Kompozer.  This  course  will  also  serve  as  a  pre-requisite  for  the  advanced  web  development technologies, which students will learn in the upcoming semester.

## G. Prerequisite Theory:

What is Data?

Data refers to the raw facts and figures that are collected and stored for future use. It can be in any form text,

## What is Information?

Information is the meaningful interpretation of data. It is the output that is obtained after processing the data to extract meaning from it.

## What is DBMS?

DBMS stands for Database Management System. It is a software  system that allows users to create, maintain, and manage databases.

## What is Metadata?

Metadata refers to the data that describes other data. It provides information about the structure, content, and context of data.

## What are Data Items?

Data items are the smallest unit of information in a database. They represent a single fact or piece of information.

## What are Fields?

Fields are the  columns or attributes  of a  table in a database. They represent the different types of information that can be stored in a table.

## What are Records?

Records are the rows or instances of a table in a database. They represent a collection of related data items.

## What is a Data Dictionary?

A data dictionary is a centralized repository that stores metadata about the data elements and data structures in a database. It provides information about the data types,  relationships,  constraints, and other properties of the database.

## What is a Schema in DBMS?

A schema is a logical structure that defines how data is organized and stored in a database. It includes the description of tables, attributes, relationships,  and constraints.

## What is a Sub-schema?

A sub-schema is a subset of the schema that describes the part of the database that is relevant to a particular user or group of users. It provides a view of the database that is tailored to the needs of the user.

## What is an Instance in DBMS?

An instance is a snapshot of the data stored in a database at a particular point in time.  It includes all the data values for the tables and records in the database. An instance is also referred to as a database state or database snapshot.

## DBMS Architecture

The DBMS design depends upon its architecture. The basic client/server architecture  is used to deal with a large number of PCs, web servers, database servers and other components that are connected with networks.

The client/server architecture consists of many PCs and a workstation which are connected via the network. DBMS architecture depends upon how users are connected to the database to get their request done.

-  Types of DBMS Architecture

![Image](DBMS_DI04032011 LAB MANUAL1_artifacts/image_000001_97e680d261ede465ae4217bce593b037b8ed09060cd89bf319a5c6a2106d6a7e.png)

Database architecture can be seen as a single tier or multi-tier. But logically, database architecture is of two types like: 2-tier architecture and 3-tier architecture.

## o 1-Tier Architecture

In this architecture, the database is directly available to the user. It means the user can directly sit on the DBMS and uses it. Any changes done here will  directly  be  done  on the  database  itself.  It  doesn't  provide  a  handytool for end users. The 1-Tier architecture is  used  for  development  of  the  local  application,  where  programmers  can  directly communicate with the database for the quick response.

## o 2-Tier Architecture

The 2-Tier architecture is same as basic client-server. In the two-tier architecture, applications on the client end can directly communicate with the database at the server side. The user interfaces and application programs are run on the client-side. The server side is responsible to provide the functionalities like: query processing and transaction management.  To  communicate  with  the  DBMS,  client-side  application  establishes  a connection with the server side.

Fig: 2-tier Architecture

![Image](DBMS_DI04032011 LAB MANUAL1_artifacts/image_000002_c8cf4744286d357f5fb2c1a196668d6e7260e629b176f1eef9033c39bad5b19b.png)

## o 3-Tier Architecture

The 3-Tier architecture contains another layer between the client and server. In this architecture, client can't directly communicate with the server. The application on the clientend  interacts  with  an  application  server  which  further  communicates  with  the  database system. End user has no idea about the existence of the database beyond the application server. The database also has no idea about any other user beyond the application. The 3Tier architecture is used in case of large web application.

## Practical No.2:

Design an E-R diagram for a library management system and convert it to relational schema

## Objective:

-  E-R  diagrams  provide  a  high-level  view  of  the  database's  purpose  and requirements, ER diagrams provide a detailed view of the database's structure and relationships. Both are essential tools in database design and development
-  To reduce data redundancy, minimize the possibility of data inconsistencies, and improve  the  performance  of  the  database.  By  following  the  principles  of normalization, you can create a database that is more organized, efficient, and easier to maintain over time.

## A. Expected Program Outcomes (POs):

1. Basic and Discipline specific knowledge: Apply knowledge of basic mathematics, science and engineering fundamentals and engineering specialization to solve the Computer Engineering problems.
2. Problem analysis: Identify and analyse well-defined Computer Engineering problems using codified standard methods.
3. Design/development of solutions: Design solutions for Computer Engineering well-defined technical problems and assist with the design of systems components or processes to meet specified needs.
4. Engineering Tools, Experimentation and Testing: Apply modern Computer Engineering tools and appropriate technique to conduct standard tests and measurements.
5. Life-long learning: Ability to analyse individual needs and engage in updating in the context of technological changes in field of engineering.

-  Ability to analyze data and identify relationships between different data points.
-  Understanding of normalization rules and techniques for organizing data in a database.

-  Proficiency in designing and implementing a normalized database schema to ensure data consistency and eliminate redundancies.

## C. Expected Course Outcomes(Cos)

Apply various Normalization techniques

## D. Practical Outcome(PRo)

-  E-R diagram used in data modeling, database design, communication, maintenance, and optimization.
-  Normalization can improve the efficiency, consistency, flexibility, and maintenance of a database.

## E. Expected Affective domain Outcome (ADos)

-  Follow safety practices.
-  Practice good housekeeping.
-  Demonstrate working as a leader/a team member.
-  Maintain tools and equipment
-  Follow ethical practices.

## F. Prerequisite Theory:

-  The Entity Relational Model is a model for identifying entities to be represented in the database and representation of how those entities are related. The ER data model specifies enterprise schema that represents the overall logical structure of a database graphically.
-  The Entity Relationship Diagram explains the relationship among the entities present in the database. ER models are used to model real-world objects like a person, a car, or  a  company  and  the  relation  between  these  real-world  objects.  In  short,  ER Diagram is the structural format of the database.

ER Model is used to model the logical view of the system from a data perspective which consists of these symbols:

## Entity

Entities  are  represented  by  means  of  rectangles.  Rectangles  are  named  with  the  entity  set  they represent.

![Image](DBMS_DI04032011 LAB MANUAL1_artifacts/image_000004_de6d3cdb1500b642c91f6cc9a2fc09b708b6fb199d8e66ace2506dae72cbea42.png)

Attributes

Attributes  are  the  properties  of  entities.  Attributes  are  represented  by  means  of  ellipses.  Every ellipse represents one attribute and is directly connected to its entity (rectangle).

![Image](DBMS_DI04032011 LAB MANUAL1_artifacts/image_000005_f8b2aa45fccf380c94113785f34447b402b1fa431f9dd346b757fca588179f65.png)

If the attributes are composite , they are further divided in a tree like structure. Every node is then connected to its attribute. That is, composite attributes are represented by ellipses that are connected with an ellipse.

Multivalued attributes are depicted by double ellipse.

![Image](DBMS_DI04032011 LAB MANUAL1_artifacts/image_000006_1c341aa722bc9d2954b347b14ad6797fb35b24b2027ee02b0803fa300bea1b5b.png)

Derived attributes are depicted by dashed ellipse.

## Relationship

Relationships are represented by diamond-shaped box. Name of the relationship is written inside the diamond-box. All the entities (rectangles) participating in a relationship, are connected to it by a line.

## Binary Relationship and Cardinality

A relationship where two entities are participating is called a binary relationship . Cardinality is the number of instance of an entity from a relation that can be associated with the relation.

-  One-to-one - When only one instance of an entity is associated with the relationship, it is marked as '1:1'. The following image reflects that only one instance of each entity should be associated with the relationship. It depicts one-to-one relationship.
-  One-to-many -  When  more  than  one  instance  of  an  entity  is  associated  with  a relationship, it is marked as '1:N'. The following image reflects that only one instance of  entity  on  the  left  and  more  than  one  instance  of  an  entity  on  the  right  can  be associated with the relationship. It depicts one-to-many relationship.

![Image](DBMS_DI04032011 LAB MANUAL1_artifacts/image_000009_e965eae57a76054d2dbbbc06b74f8a378cad4c42f0f7686d8220a053ee3e8bbd.png)

-  Many-to-one -  When  more  than  one  instance  of  entity  is  associated  with  the relationship, it is marked as 'N:1'. The following image reflects that more than one instance of an entity on the left and only one instance of an entity on the right can be associated with the relationship. It depicts many-to-one relationship.
-  Many-to-many -  The following image reflects that more than one instance of an entity on the left and more than one instance of an entity on the right can be associated with the relationship. It depicts many-to-many relationship.

## Participation Constraints

-  Total Participation - Each entity is involved in the relationship. Total participation is represented by double lines.
-  Partial  participation -  Not  all  entities  are  involved  in  the  relationship.  Partial participation is represented by single lines.

![Image](DBMS_DI04032011 LAB MANUAL1_artifacts/image_000013_3194ecabb18cc48aa4817e006af11587d87b13649c4b9ae1c2c7cecee9f7b9ae.png)

## G. Prerequisite Theory:

##  SQL DATA TYPES:-

-  CHAR (size)
-  VARCHAR (size)/VARCHAR2 (size)
-  DATE
-  NUMBER (P, S)
-  LONG
-  RAW/LONGRAW

##  CHAR (SIZE)

-  This data type is used to store alphanumeric data of fixed length.
-  The size represents length of character to be stored.
-  This data type can store maximum 2000 characters.
-  This is faster to access but requires more storage.

##  VARCHAR (size)/VARCHAR2 (size)

-  This data type is used to store variable length alphanumeric data.
-  The maximum size of this data type is 4000 characters.
-  This is slower to access in comparison to CHAR but is efficient for storage.

##  DATE

-  This data type is used to store date and time.
-  The standard format is DD-MON-YY for example 21-JUN-09.
-  Date time stores time in the 24-hours format.
-  Range of this data type is January 1, 4712 B.C. to December 31, 4712A.D.

##  NUMBER (P,S)

-  The  NUMBER  data  type  is  used  store  numbers  (both  Integer  and  floating-point numbers).
-  We can store number up to 38 characters long.
-  The precision (P), determines the maximum length of number, and scale (s), determines the decimal point sign(.) on the right of  a number (P).

##  LONG

-  This data type is used to store variable length character strings upto 2GB.
-  LONG data can be used to store binary data in ASCII format.

##  RAW/LONG RAW

-  The  RAW/LONG RAW data type is used to store  binary  data,  such  as digitized picture or image.
-  RAW data type can have a maximum length of 255 bytes.
-  LONG RAW data type can contain upto 2GB.

##  DESCRIBE COMMAND

-  DESCRIBE or DESC (both are same) command to describe the structure of a table.
-  DESCRIBE or DESC command shows the structure of table which include name of the column, data-type of column and the nullability which means, that column can contain null values or not.
-  All of these features of table are described at the time of Creation of table.

## Syntax:

- SQL&gt; DESCRIBE TABLE NAME;
- OR
- SQL&gt; DESC TABLE NAME;

##  SQL DDL (DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE) COMMANDS:-

-  CREATE
-  ALTER
-  RENAME
-  TRUNCATE
-  DROP

##  CREATE

-  Create command is used to create a table in database.

## Syntax:

SQL&gt; CREATE TABLE TABLE NAME ( COLUMNNAME\_1  DATATYPE(DATASIZE), COLUMNNAME\_2  DATATYPE(DATASIZE),

……….

COLUMNNAME\_NDATATYPE(DATASIZE) );

## Example:

SQL&gt;  CREATE  TABLE  CLIENT\_MASTER  (CLIENT\_NO  VARCHAR2(6),  NAME VARCHAR2(20),  CITY    VARCHAR2(15),  PINCODE  NUMBER(8),  STATE VARCHAR2(15));

## Show the Structure of a Table:

| PINCODE   |         | NUMBER(8)    |
| STATE     |         | VARCHAR2(15) |

##  ALTER

-  ALTER command is used to ALTER (Modify structure of) a table in database.
-  ALTER command is used in five ways.
1. To add new column in table.
2. To modify data type or data size of existing column of table.
3. To drop (remove) the existing column of table.
4. To rename the name of existing table.
5. To rename the name of existing column of table.

-  Maintain tools and equipment
-  Follow ethical practices.

## G. Prerequisite Theory:

##  SQL DML (DATA MANIPLUATION LANGUAGE) COMMANDS:-

 INSERT

 UPDATE

 DELETE

##  INSERT

-  Insert command is Used to insert data into a table or create a new row in table:
-  We have two methods to insert data in a table
1. By value method
2. By address method

## Syntax: (1 st  way-BY value method)

## 1 st  Way

SQL&gt;INSERT  INTO  TABLENAME  VALUES  (VALUE\_1,VALUE\_2,  VALUE\_3  …. VALUE\_N);

OR

## 2 nd  Way

SQL&gt; INSERT INTO  TABLENAME  (COLUMN\_1,  COLUMN\_2,  COLUMN\_3 ………COLUMN\_N) VALUES (VALUE\_1, VALUE\_2, VALUE\_3 …. VALUE\_N);

## Example:

## 1 st  Way

SQL&gt; INSERT INTO CLIENT\_MASTER VALUES ('C00001', 'RAHUL', 'MUMBAI', 400054,' MAHARASHTRA');

OR

## 2 nd  Way

SQL&gt;INSERT INTO CLIENT\_MASTER (CLIENT\_NO, NAME,CITY, PINCODE, [INSERT MORE VALUE]

STATE) VALUES ('C00001', 'RAHUL', 'MUMBAI', 400054, 'MAHARASHTRA'); 'MANISH',

SQL&gt;INSERT INTO CLIENT\_MASTER VALUES ('C00002', 'BANGALORE',560001, 'KARNATAKA');

To insert a new record again you have to type entire insert command, if there are lot of records this will be difficult. This will be avoided by using address method.

## Show the Records of a Table:

## Syntax:

SQL&gt; select * from  client\_master;

Client\_no

|        | Name   | City      |   Pincode | State       |
|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| C00001 | RAHUL  | Mumbai    |    400054 | Maharashtra |
| C00002 | MANISH | Bangalore |    560001 | Karnataka   |

## Syntax: (2 nd  way-BY address method)

SQL&gt;INSERT INTO TABLENAME VALUES (&amp;COLUMN\_1, &amp;COLUMN\_2,…. &amp; COLUMN\_N);

## OR

SQL&gt; INSERT INTO TABLENAME(COLUMN\_1, COLUMN\_2, COLUMN\_3 ………COLUMN\_N) VALUES (&amp;COLUMN\_1, &amp;COLUMN\_2, &amp;COLUMN\_3 …. &amp;COLUMN\_N);

This will prompt you for the values but for every insert you have to use forward slash .

## Example:

SQL&gt; INSERT INTO CLIENT\_MASTER VALUES ('&amp;CLIENT\_NO', '&amp;NAME', '&amp;CITY', &amp;PINCODE, '&amp;STATE ');

Enter value for client\_no: C0001

Enter value for name: Rahul

Enter value for city: Mumbai

Enter value for pincode: 400054

Enter value for state: Maharashtra

## SQL&gt;

Enter value for client\_no: C0002

Enter value for name: Manish

Enter value for city: Bangalore

Enter value for pincode: 560001

Enter value for state: Karnataka

## Show the Records of a Table:

Syntax:

SQL&gt; SELECT * FROM CLIENT\_MASTER;

CLIENT\_NO

|        | NAME                  | CITY         PINCODE   | STATE                                            |
|--------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| C00001 | RAHUL          MUMBAI | 400054                 | MAHARASHTRA                                      |
| C00002 | MANISH                |                        | BANGALO    560001                      KARNATAKA |

##  UPDATE

-  The UPDATE command is used to change or modify data of a table
-  The Update command is used to update selected rows from table or all the rows from table

## Syntax:(update selected rows)

SQL&gt; UPDATE TABLENAME SET COLUMNNAME\_1 = EXPRESSION\_1, COLUMNNAME\_2 = EXPRESSION\_2 WHERE CONDITION;

## Example:

SQL&gt;UPDATE CLIENT\_MASTER SET CITY='BOMBAY' WHERE CLIENT\_NO='C00002';

## Show the Records of a Table:

## Syntax:

SQL&gt; SELECT * FROM CLIENT\_MASTER;

| CLIENT_NO   | NAME   | CITY   |   PINCODE | STATE       |
|-------------|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| C00001      | RAHUL  | MUMBAI |    400054 | MAHARASHTRA |
| C00002      | MANISH | BOMBAY |    560001 | KARNATAKA   |

## Syntax:(update all rows)

SQL&gt;UPDATE TABLENAME SET COLUMNNAME\_1 = EXPRESSION\_1;

## Example:

SQL&gt;UPDATE CLIENT\_MASTER SET NAME = 'OHM';

## Show the Records of a Table:

## Syntax:

SQL&gt; SELECT * FROM CLIENT\_MASTER;

| CLIENT_NO   | NAME   CITY       |   PINCODE | STATE       |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| C00001      | OHM        MUMBAI |    400054 | MAHARASHTRA |
| C00002      | OHM        BOMBAY |    560001 | KARNATAKA   |

##  DELETE

-  The DELETE command is used to delete data  or rows from a table
-  The  delete command is used to delete selected rows from table or All the rows from table

## Syntax: (delete selected rows)

SQL&gt; DELETE FROM TABLENAME WHERE CONDITION;

## Example:

SQL&gt; DELETE FROM CLIENT\_MASTER WHERE CLIENT\_NO='C00001';

## Show the Records of a Table:

## Syntax:

SQL&gt; SELECT * FROM CLIENT\_MASTER;

| CLIENT_NO   | NAME   | CITY   |   PINCODE | STATE     |
|-------------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| C00002      | OHM    | BOMBAY |    560001 | KARNATAKA |

## Syntax: (delete all rows)

SQL&gt; DELETE FROM TABLE NAME;

## Example:

SQL&gt; DELETE FROM CLIENT\_MASTER;

## Show the Records of a Table:

Syntax:

SQL&gt; SELECT * FROM CLIENT\_MASTER;

SQL&gt;No Rows selected

##  SELECT

 The SELECT command is used to retrieve selected rows from one or more tables.

Syntax: (retrieve all table data )

SQL&gt;SELECT * FROM  TABLE\_NAME;

Example:

SQL&gt; SELECT * FROM CLIENT\_MASTER;

Syntax: (retrieve particular columns of a table )

SQL&gt; SELECT NAME, CITY FROM CLIENT\_MASTER;

Syntax: (retrieve particular column of particular row of a table )

SQL&gt; SELECT COLUMNNAME\_N  FROM   TABLE\_NAME  WHERE  CONDITION;

SQL&gt;SELECT  NAME  FROM CLIENT\_MASTER WHERE CITY='BOMBAY';

Syntax: (retrieve particular rows of a table )

SQL&gt; SELECT * FROM   TABLE\_NAME  WHERE  CONDITION;

SQL&gt;SELECT * FROM CLIENT\_MASTER WHERE CITY='BOMBAY';

##  SQL Operators

-  Arithmetic Operators
-  Oracle allows arithmetic operators to use while viewing records from table or while performing data manipulation operations such as Insert, Update and Delete.
-  These are:

+   Addition                             * Multiplication

- ** Exponentiation                  () Enclosed operation

-    Subtraction                         / Division

## Example:

SQL&gt;Select product\_no, description, sell\_price * 0.05 from product\_master;

##  Logical Operators

-  The AND Operator
-  The OR Operator
-  The NOT Operator

##  The AND Operator

-  The AND Operator allows creating an SQL statement based on two or more conditions being met.
-  It can be used in any valid SQL statement such as select, insert, or delete.

## Example:

SQL&gt;SELECT    PRODUCT\_NO,    DESCRIPTION,    SELL\_PRICE    *    0.05    FROM PRODUCT\_MASTER WHERE SELL\_PRICE BETWEEN 500 AND 1100;

##  The OR Operator

-  The  OR  condition  allows  creating  an  SQL  statement  where  records  are returned when any one of the conditions are met
-  It can be used in any valid SQL statement such as select, insert, or delete.

## Example:

SQL&gt;SELECT CLIENT\_NO, NAME, CITY, PINCODE FROM CLIENT\_MASTER WHERE PINCODE=4000054 OR PINCODE=4000057;

##  The NOT Operator

-  The Oracle engine will process all rows in a table and display only those Records that do not satisfy the condition specified Example:

SQL&gt;SELECT * FROM CLIENT\_MASTER  WHERE NOT (  CITY='BOMBAY' OR CITY='DELHI');

##  Comparison Operators

-  Comparison operators are used in condition to compare one expression with other.
-  The comparison operators are =, &lt;, &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, !=, between, like, is null and in operators

##  Between operator

-  Between operator is used to check between two values or specific range Example:

SQL&gt;SELECT * FROM SALESMAN\_MASTER WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 5000 AND 8000;

The above select statement will display only those rows where salary of salesman is between 5000 and 8000.

##  In operator:

-  The IN operator can be used to select rows that match one of the values in a list. SQL&gt; SELECT * FROM CLIENT\_MASTER WHERE CLIENT\_NO IN(C00001, C00003);

The above query will retrieve only those rows where client\_no is either in C00001 or C00003

##  Like operator:

-  The Like operator is used to search character pattern.
-  The like operator is used with special character % and \_(underscore)
- SQL&gt; SELECT * FROM CLIENT\_MASTER WHERE CITY LIKE ' B% ';
- The above select statement will display only those rows where city is start with 'b' followed by any number of any characters.
- % sign is used to refer number of character ( it similar to * asterisk wildcard in DOS). While \_(underscore) is used to refer single character.
- SQL&gt; SELECT * FROM CLIENT\_MASTER WHERE NAME LIKE '\_AHUL';

## Practical No.7:

Implement SQL queries using Conversion Functions like to- char, to-date, to-number and Group functions like Avg, Min, Max, Sum, Count, Decode etc.

## Note : Consider HR.EMPLOYEES table to solve all queries.

## Write down the queries using conversion and miscellaneous function:-

1. Convert '+01234.78' to number.
2. Convert a value 123789 to character using '9,99,999' format.
3. List out hire date in form of 'Saturday,14 th feb,2009' for employee.(consider HR.EMPLOYEES table)
4. List out hire date  in form of '23-march-1985' for all employee.(consider employee table)
5. If input value is 'MAX' then display message 'this is maximum', if input value is 'MIN' then display message 'this is minimum' otherwise display message 'this is equal'.

## Write down the queries using GROUP function:-

## Consider HR.EMPLOYEES table to solve all queries.

1. Find maximum salary from a table.
2. Find minimum salary from table.
3. Find sum of all and distinct salary from a table.
4. Find average of all and distinct average from a table.
5. Find total number of employees.
6. Find total number of rows for each column from a table.

## A. Objective:

Implementing SQL conversion functions in SQL queries is to convert data from one data type to another data type and manipulate data that is stored in different formats and group functions is to perform calculations on a set of values that are grouped together  based  on  a  specific  column  or  columns.  These  group  functions  are  also known as aggregate functions because they aggregate multiple rows into a single result.

## F. Expected Affective domain Outcome (ADos)

-  Follow safety practices.
-  Practice good housekeeping.
-  Demonstrate working as a leader/a team member.
-  Maintain tools and equipment
-  Follow ethical practices.

## G. Prerequisite Theory:

- ORACLE installation

##  SQL SET OPERATORS:-

-  UNION
-  UNION ALL

 INTERSECT

 MINUS

Consider faculty\_detail table to understand all example of set operators.

##  UNION

-  The  UNION  set  operator  returns  all  distinct  rows  selected  by  either  query,  without ignoring the NULL values. That means any duplicate rows will be removed. (ascending by default)

Syntax:

SQL&gt; SELECT COLUMNNAME FROM TABLENAME

UNION

SELECT COLUMNNAME FROM TABLENAME;

## Example:

SQL&gt; SELECT FNAME FROM FACULTY\_DETAIL WHERE UNION

SEMESTER=3

SELECT FNAME FROM FACULTY\_DETAIL WHERE

SEMESTER=5;

SQL&gt; FNAME

--------------------

ADS

BPP

HJP

JNA

SBD

SDS

VAV

##  UNION ALL

-  The UNION ALL set operator returns all rows selected by either query, without ignoring the NULL values. That means any duplicates will remain in the final result set.

## Syntax:

SQL&gt; SELECT COLUMNNAME FROM TABLENAME

UNION ALL

SELECT COLUMNNAME FROM TABLENAME;

## Example:

SQL&gt; SELECT FNAME FROM FACULTY\_DETAIL    WHERE SEMESTER=3

UNION ALL

SELECT FNAME FROM FACULTY\_DETAIL WHERE SEMESTER=5;

SQL&gt; FNAME

--------------------

SBD

VAV

SDS

JNA

BPP

HJP

ADS

BPP

HJP

ADS

##  INTERSECT

-  The INTERSECT set operator returns all distinct rows selected by both queries. That means only those rows common to both queries will be present in the final result set.

## Syntax:

SQL&gt; SELECT FNAME FROM FACULTY\_DETAIL    WHERE

SQL&gt; SELECT COLUMNNAME FROM TABLENAME

INTERSECT

SELECT COLUMNNAME FROM TABLENAME;

## Example:

SEMESTER=3

INTERSECT

SELECT FNAME FROM FACULTY\_DETAIL WHERE

SEMESTER=5;

SQL&gt; FNAME

--------------------

ADS

BPP

## HJP

##  MINUS

-  The MINUS set operator returns all distinct rows selected by the first query but not the second. This is functionally equivalent to the ANSI set operator EXCEPT DISTINCT.

## Syntax:

SQL&gt; SELECT COLUMNNAME FROM TABLENAME

MINUS

SELECT COLUMNNAME FROM TABLENAME;

Example:

SQL&gt; SELECT FNAME FROM FACULTY\_DETAIL    WHERE

SEMESTER=3

MINUS

SELECT FNAME FROM FACULTY\_DETAIL WHERE

SEMESTER=5;

SQL&gt; FNAME

## PRACTICAL 11: Implement SQL queries for CREATE USER, GRANT,REVOKE and DROP USER command.

## Objective:

To understand the concept of administrative commands

## Theory:

DATABASE is collection of coherent data.  To create database we  have :

Syntax:

CREATE DATABASE&lt;database\_name&gt;

Example :

CREATE DATABASE my\_db;

## TABLESPACE:

The oracle database consists of one or more logical storage units called table spaces. Each    table space in an Oracle database consists of one or more files called datafiles, which are physical structures that confirm to the operating system in which Oracle is running.

Syntax:

CREATE&lt;tablespace name&gt;

DATAFILE'C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\10.2.0\  server \&lt;file name.dbf 'SIZE 50M;

Example:

Create tablespace te\_cs DATAFILE

'C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\10.2.0\  server\usr.dbf 'SIZE 50M;

## CREATE USER:

The DBA creates user by executing  CREATE USER statement.

The user is someone who connects  to the database if enough privilege is granted.

## Syntax:

SQL&gt;  CREATE USER &lt; username&gt; -- (name of user to be created ) --

IDENTIFIED BY  &lt; password&gt; password)

(specifies that the user must login with this

SQL&gt; user created

Eg: create user James identified by bob ;

(The user does not have privilege at this time, it has to be granted.These privileges determine  what user can do at database level.)

## PRIVILEGES:

A privilege is a right to execute an SQL statement or to access another user's object.  In Oracle, there are two types of privileges

-  System Privileges
-  Object Privileges
-  System Privileges : are those through which the user can manage the performance of  database actions. It is normally granted by DBA to users.

Eg: Create Session,Create Table,Create user etc..

-  allow access to objects or privileges on object, i.e.
- Object Privileges : tables, table  columns. tables,views etc..It includes alter,delete,insert,select update etc.

(After creating the user, DBA grant specific system privileges to user)

## GRANT:

The DBA uses the GRANT statement to allocate system privileges to other user.

## Syntax:

SQL&gt; GRANT privilege

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

USER ;

SQL&gt; Grant succeeded

Eg: Grant create session, create table, create view  to James;

Object privileges vary from object to object.An owner has all privilege or specific privileges  on object.

SQL&gt; GRANT object\_priv

[(column)]  ON  object

TO user;

SQL&gt;GRANT select, insert ON emp TO James;

SQL&gt;GRANT select ,update (e\_name,e\_address)

```
ON emp  TO James;
```

## CHANGE PASSWORD:

The DBA creates an account and initializes a password for every user.You can change  password by using ALTER USER statement.

## Syntax:

Alter USER &lt; some user name &gt;

IDENTIFIED BY&lt; New password &gt;

Eg: ALTER

USER

James

IDENTIFIE

D BY sam

## REVOKE:

REVOKE statement is used to remove privileges granted to other users. The privileges you  specify are revoked from the users.

## Syntax:

REVOKE

[ privilege..

ON

FROM

```
…] object user
```

Eg:

- REVOKE create session,create table from James;
- REVOKE

select ,insert          ON

emp

FROM James

## ROLE:

A role is a named group of related privileges that can be granted to user.In other words, role  is a predefined collection of previleges that are grouped together,thus privileges are

## DBMS (DI04032011)

easier to  assign user.

SQL&gt; Create role custom ;

SQL&gt; Grant create table, create view TO custom ; SQL&gt;  Grant  select,  insert  ON emp  TO custom ;

Eg: Grant custom to James, Steve;

## Source code :

## DBMS (DI04032011)

## Exercise:

1. Create user and implement the following commands on relation (Emp and Dept).
2. Develop a query to grant all privileges of employees table into departments table.
3. Develop a query to grant some privileges of employees table into departments table.
4. Develop a query to revoke all privileges of employees table from departments table.
5. Develop a query to revoke some privileges of employees table from departments table.

## F. Expected Affective domain Outcome (ADos)

-  Follow safety practices.
-  Practice good housekeeping.

-  Demonstrate working as a leader/a team member.
-  Maintain tools and equipment
-  Follow ethical practices.

## G. Prerequisite Theory:

-  Domain Integrity, Entity Integrity, and Referential Integrity are fundamental concepts  in  database  management  systems  (DBMS)  like  Oracle.  These constraints ensure that the data stored in the database is accurate, consistent, and valid.
1. Domain Integrity: Domain Integrity ensures that the values entered in a column or attribute of a table conform to a specified data type or domain. For example, if a column is defined as storing only positive integers, any attempt to enter a negative number or a non-integer value will be rejected.
2. Entity Integrity: Entity Integrity ensures that each row or record in a table has a unique identifier, typically a primary key. This constraint guarantees that there are no duplicate records in the table, ensuring that each record can be identified uniquely.
3. Referential Integrity: Referential Integrity ensures that the relationships between tables are maintained by enforcing the consistency of foreign key values. For example, if a table has a foreign key constraint that references a primary key in another table, the referential integrity constraint ensures that any changes to the referenced primary key value are reflected in the foreign key value in the referencing table.
- In Oracle, these constraints can be defined when creating a table or added later using the ALTER TABLE statement. For example,
-  To add a domain integrity constraint to a table, the following syntax can be used:

ALTER TABLE table\_name

ADD CONSTRAINT constraint\_name

CHECK (column\_name &lt;value&gt;)

-  To add a primary key constraint to a table, the following syntax can be used:

ALTER TABLE table\_name

ADD CONSTRAINT constraint\_name

PRIMARY KEY (column\_name)

-  To add a foreign key constraint to a table, the following syntax can be used:

ALTER TABLE table\_name ADD CONSTRAINT constraint\_name FOREIGN KEY (column\_name)

REFERENCES referenced\_table (referenced\_column)

-  Follow ethical practices.

## M. Prerequisite Theory:

-  The  Entity  Relational  Model  is  a  model  for  identifying  entities  to  be  represented  in  the database and representation of how those entities are related. The ER data model specifies enterprise schema that represents the overall logical structure of a database graphically.
-  The Entity Relationship Diagram explains the relationship among the entities present in the database. ER models are used to model real-world objects like a person, a car, or a company and the relation between these real-world objects. In short, ER Diagram is the structural format of the database.

ER Model is used to model the logical view of the system from a data perspective which consists of these symbols:

## Entity

Entities are represented by means of rectangles. Rectangles are named with the entity set they represent.

## Attributes

Attributes  are  the  properties  of  entities.  Attributes  are  represented  by  means  of  ellipses.  Every  ellipse represents one attribute and is directly connected to its entity (rectangle).

![Image](DBMS_DI04032011 LAB MANUAL1_artifacts/image_000016_f3df35156444708f327bc5829b6b54b7da760165cb0261d836b5a6ea16a70349.png)

If the attributes are composite , they are further divided in a tree like structure. Every node is then connected to its attribute. That is, composite attributes are represented by ellipses that are connected with an ellipse.

## Relationship

Relationships  are  represented  by  diamond-shaped  box.  Name  of  the  relationship  is  written  inside  the diamond-box. All the entities (rectangles) participating in a relationship, are connected to it by a line.

## Binary Relationship and Cardinality

A relationship  where  two  entities  are  participating  is  called  a binary  relationship .  Cardinality  is  the number of instance of an entity from a relation that can be associated with the relation.

-  One-to-one - When only one instance of an entity is associated with the relationship, it is marked as '1:1'. The following image reflects that only one instance of each entity should be associated with the relationship. It depicts one-to-one relationship.

![Image](DBMS_DI04032011 LAB MANUAL1_artifacts/image_000020_1b755f9bcb885407244c1e0f1295595afe16abb3dfc1cb3b78af19371f0a9574.png)

-  One-to-many - When more than one instance of an entity is associated with a relationship, it is marked as '1:N'. The following image reflects that only one instance of entity on the left and more than one instance of an entity on the right can be associated with the relationship. It depicts one-to-many relationship.
-  Many-to-one - When more than one instance of entity is associated with the relationship, it is marked as 'N:1'. The following image reflects that more than one instance of an entity on the left and only one instance of an entity on the right can be associated with the relationship. It depicts many-to-one relationship.
-  Many-to-many - The following image reflects that more than one instance of an entity on the  left  and  more  than  one  instance  of  an  entity  on  the  right  can  be  associated  with  the relationship. It depicts many-to-many relationship.
-  Total  Participation -  Each  entity  is  involved  in  the  relationship.  Total  participation  is represented by double lines.

-  Partial participation - Not all entities are involved in the relationship. Partial participation is represented by single lines.

![Image](DBMS_DI04032011 LAB MANUAL1_artifacts/image_000024_a8fbb08f738042331da3ef4258a82e6ef49d1bb0932fc38b11dded76bb7e6f28.png)

## Normalization

-  Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.
-  Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations. It is also used to eliminate undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies.
-  Normalization divides the larger table into smaller and links them using relationships.
-  The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table.

The main reason for normalizing the relations is removing these anomalies. Failure to eliminate anomalies leads  to  data  redundancy  and  can  cause  data  integrity  and  other  problems  as  the  database  grows. Normalization consists of a series of guidelines that helps to guide you in creating a good database structure.

## Data modification anomalies can be categorized into three types:

-  Insertion Anomaly: Insertion Anomaly refers to when one cannot insert a new tuple into a relationship due to lack of data.
-  Deletion Anomaly: The delete anomaly refers to the situation where the deletion of data results in the unintended loss of some other important data.
-  Updatation Anomaly: The update anomaly is when an update of a single data value requires multiple rows of data to be updated.

## Types of Normal Forms:

| Normal  Form   | Description                                                                                                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1NF            | A relation is in 1NF if it contains an atomic value.                                                                     |
| 2NF            | A relation will be in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent  on the primary key. |
| 3NF            | A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and no transition dependency exists.                                           |
| BCNF           | A stronger definition of 3NF is known as Boyce Codd's normal form.                                                       |
| 4NF            | A  relation  will  be  in  4NF  if  it  is  in  Boyce  Codd's  normal  form  and  has  no  multi-valued                  |

## DBMS (DI04032011)

|     | dependency.                                                                                                   |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 5NF | A relation is in 5NF. If it is in 4NF and does not contain any join dependency,   joining should be lossless. |

## DBMS (DI04032011)

-  Practice good housekeeping.
-  Demonstrate working as a leader/a team member.
-  Maintain tools and equipment
-  Follow ethical practices.

## G. Prerequisite Theory:

- ORACLE installation
- Syntax of DDL Commands

## TCL Commands in SQL- Transaction Control Language Examples:

Transaction Control Language can be defined as the portion of a database language used for maintaining consistency of the database and managing transactions in database. A set of SQL statements that are corelated logically and executed on the data stored in the table is known as transaction. In this tutorial, you will learn different TCL Commands in SQL with examples and difference between them.

2. Commit Command
3. Rollback Command
4. Savepoint Command

## Commit Commands:

The main use of Commit command is to make the changes done by the transaction permanent in the database.

## Syntax: COMMIT;

## Example:

UPDATE STUDENT SET STUDENT\_NAME = 'Maria' WHERE STUDENT\_NAME = 'Meena';

## COMMIT;

By using the above set of instructions, you can update the wrong student name by the correct one and save it permanently in the database. The update transaction gets completed when commit is used. If commit is not used, then there will be lock on 'Meena' record till the rollback or commit is issued.

Now have a look at the below diagram where 'Meena' is updated and there is a lock on her record. The updated value is permanently saved in the database after the use of commit and lock is released.

|   Student ID | Student Name   |
|--------------|----------------|
|           78 | Jane           |
|           79 | Meena          |

## DBMS (DI04032011)

## After Update :

|   Student ID | Student Name   |
|--------------|----------------|
|           78 | Jane           |
|           79 | Maria          |

## After Commit :

|   Student ID | Student Name   |
|--------------|----------------|
|           78 | Jane           |
|           79 | Maria          |

## Rollback:

Using this command, the database can be restored to the last committed state. Additionally, it is also used with savepoint command for jumping to a savepoint in a transaction.

Syntax:

ROLLBACK;

## OR

ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT\_NAME;

Example:

## UPDATE STUDENT SET STUDENT\_NAME = 'Manish' WHERE STUDENT\_NAME = 'Meena';

## ROLLBACK;

This command is used when the user realizes that he/she has updated the wrong information and wants to undo this update. The users can issue ROLLBACK command and then undo the update. Have a look at the below tables to know better about the implementation of this command.

|   Student ID | Student Name   |
|--------------|----------------|
|           78 | Jane           |
|           79 | Meena          |

## After Update :

|   Student ID | Student Name   |
|--------------|----------------|
|           78 | Jane           |
|           79 | Manish         |

## After Rollback:

|   Student ID | Student Name   |
|--------------|----------------|
|           78 | Jane           |
|           79 | Meena          |

## Savepoint:

The main use of the Savepoint command is to save a transaction temporarily. This way users can rollback to the point whenever it is needed.

Syntax: SAVEPOINT SAVEPOINT\_NAME;

## DBMS (DI04032011)

## Example:

## SAVEPOINT SAVEPOINT\_NAME;

## Following is the table of a school class

|   ID | Name    |
|------|---------|
|   98 | Anita   |
|   99 | Maria   |
|  100 | Katilyn |

## Use some SQL queries on the above table and then watch the results

INSERT into CLASS VALUES (101, 'Rahul);

Commit;

UPDATE CLASS SET NAME= 'Tyler' where id= 101;

SAVEPOINT A;

INSERT INTO CLASS VALUES (102, 'Zack');

Savepoint B;

INSERT INTO CLASS VALUES (103, 'Bruno')

Savepoint C;

SELECT * FROM CLASS;

The result will look like

|   ID | Name    |
|------|---------|
|   98 | Anita   |
|   99 | Maria   |
|  100 | Katilyn |
|  101 | Tyler   |
|  102 | Zack    |
|  103 | Bruno   |

## Now rollback to savepoint B

ROLLBACK TO B;

SELECT * FROM CLASS;

|   ID | Name    |
|------|---------|
|   98 | Anita   |
|   99 | Maria   |
|  100 | Katilyn |
|  101 | Tyler   |
|  102 | Zack    |

## Now rollback to savepoint A

ROLLBACK TO A; SELECT * FROM CLASS;

## DCL Commands

## Create user -

If a login ID does not exist, it has to be created manually. The following steps indicate how a DBA login ID is created and appropriate privileges given to the DBA login ID with a special focus on creating table space.

## Creating a User:-

SYNTAX: CREATE USER USERNAME IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD;

## Example:-

![Image](DBMS_DI04032011 LAB MANUAL1_artifacts/image_000025_368379b2feb100392793128fc24f5be2796878e88403a99814da5bb991464726.png)

When we create a user in SQL, it is not even allowed to login and create a session until and unless proper permissions/privileges are granted to the user.

Following command can be used to grant the session creating privileges.

SYNTAX: -

GRANT CREATE SESSION, connect, resource TO username;

Unlocking a user account:-

SYNTAX: ALTER USER account IDENTIFIED BY password ACCOUNT UNLOCK;

## DCL Commands

Oracle provides two commands - GRANT and REVOKE - to control the access of various database objects.

## GRANT COMMAND

Grants a privilege to a user. It means that giving authority to other user by administrator. If you are an administrator then only you have the authority for granting the privilege to other users. User can grant

|   ID | Name    |
|------|---------|
|   98 | Anita   |
|   99 | Maria   |
|  100 | Katilyn |
|  101 | Tyler   |

privilege only if user has been granted that privilege

Syntax  : GRANT  &lt;  OBJECT  PRIVILEGES  &gt;  ON  &lt;OBJECTNAME&gt;  TO  &lt;USERNAME&gt;  [WITH GRANT OPTION];

## OBJECT PRIVILEGES

Each object privilege that is granted authorizes the grantee to perform some operation on the object. A user can grant all the privileges or grant only specific object privileges.

The list of object privileges is as follows:

ALTER: Allows the grantee to change the table definition with the ALTER TABLE command DELETE: Allows the grantee to remove the records from the table with the DELETE command INDEX: Allows the grantee to create an index on the table with the CREATE INDEX command INSERT: Allows the grantee to add records to the table with the INSERT command SELECT: Allows the grantee to query the table with the SELECT command UPDATE: Allows the grantee to modify the records in the tables with the UPDATE command

Example:

Give the user rahul permission to only view and modify records in the table client\_master.
